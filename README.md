# ViRus

During my second year of my Bachelors program, covid-19 took the world by storm and my University took a hit as well. Because of that, I wasn't able to build a real-life installation and thus a VR installation has been made.

Together with other students, we made ViRus a VR body scan of what covid does to the body.
